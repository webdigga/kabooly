faqs:
  - question: Is there a contract?
    answer: Yes there is a contract. I will prepare this after the agreed purchase and can go over any of the details you are unsure of.
  - question: Are there any upfont costs?
    answer: Absolutely none. Once the contract is signed I will begin working to build the site. Once it's live I will invoice for the first month's payment.
  - question: Will I own the website?
    answer: After the first 12 months you are free to take the website files and host these wherever you choose.
  - question: Will I need to buy or renew a domain?
    answer: If you have your domain already then I will handle the DNS changes. If you do not then I will buy the domain for you and manage the renewal myself.
  - question: If I want a new feature, how does this get implemented?
    answer: After we've agreed sign off on the initial site build, any future feature requests will be handled on an ad-hoc basis.
  - question: Can I stop paying whenever I want?
    answer: There is a 30 day notice period to cancel the contract. If this should happen in the first 12 months then the website files will not be handed over as part of the termination.
